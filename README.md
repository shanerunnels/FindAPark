## FIND A PARK

# Description 
This application was created to show the user the various state parks around the country.  Most people love the outdoors, but only know about a couple of the beautiful state parks in our country.  So this app allows the user to explore unknown (to them) parks.  The user can then decide if the particular park they are looking at is worth visiting.  This application was created using: HTML, CSS, PureCSS, Javascript, jQuery, Umbrella.js, as well as, utilizing the APIs provided by the National Park Services, and Bing Maps.  This was a group project and was a great lesson in learning to work together towards a common goal.

# Use
When the user opens the application, they will see an input form on the left of the screen where they will be told to input the appreviation of the state they would like to explore.  Once they have selected their state, up to five buttons will be created below the input, each with a name of the park in the state chosen.  As the user clicks each button, various information will appear on the page.  This information ranges from, contact info, park hours, various activities that can be done, along with a map showing where the state park is located.
